About Sincy
*****************
Thank you for considering the download and use of the Sincy Single Cycle MIPS Simulator! We worked very hard to bring you this program and hope that it supplements your understanding of the MIPS process lifecycle. This program is intended for students who are taking or are interested in taking a computer architecture course. In order to use the software, one must be familiar with basic assembly language syntax and its use. The only thing you need to begin to use this software is a computer capable of running a simple Java Applet. The program is fairly basic and about 1.5MB and should run on virtually any machine made in the last 30 years.
